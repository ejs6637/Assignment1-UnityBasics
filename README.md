Scene 1 - Unity Primitives
This is a scene using 4 different types of primitives: cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes. I recreated a castle using cubes and cylinders, a UFO created from spheres, and grass from a plane.

Scene 2 - Maze with Character Controller
This is a scene that displays a top-down view of a maze, with the cylinder acting as the character controller. You can navigate through the maze and fall off the plane to escape it.

Scene 3 - VR 360
This is a scene that reuses Scene 1, but during the night. I also added the moon, created with a spherical primitive object. I created a skybox with a new material and set the color to black to emulate nighttime. You can walk around the castle area with full VR support with the WASD keys; however, the controls are a little janky.
